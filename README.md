## Hi, I'm Xavier.

I'm a software developer transitioning from a background in music composition.
I specialize in JavaScript and automation tools and am expanding into full-stack development.

Tech:
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Java
- Git
- HTML/CSS
- SQL (learning)
- AWS (learning)

Currently working on:
- Building a small full-stack web application with REST APIs and SQL integration
- Refactoring my Twitch bot for cleaner architecture and modular design
- Learning database design and query optimization (MySQL)
